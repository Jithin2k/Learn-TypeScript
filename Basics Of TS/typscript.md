Infer Types/Implicit Types - Automatic type detection by TS iteself;

Explicit Types - Manually types are defined

Data Types --> String,Number,Boolean,Array,Object.

- Interface - It defines what properties and methods an object should have, but not how theyâ€™re implemented.

* Interfaces are used purely for type-checking and are removed during compilation.
